-To add translations for your own language, add a new property that has your language code as a key and the translation as a value to each of the string objects.

Example of adding Chinese would be:
```
...
{
  "Key": "_CCA_LOG_CAL_ADDED_",
  "EN": "CCA added to Custom Actor List",
  "ZH":"CCA 添加到自定义演员列表"
},
...
```

-You are also welcome to proofread and spell check the translations and submit corrections to found issues.
